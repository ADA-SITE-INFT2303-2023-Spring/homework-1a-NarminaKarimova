2.	Business Need
Today, especially after the period of pandemic, people became more concerned about their health. They are constantly searching for the meaning of their symptoms to learn about their health condition, but without proper medical education, simple “Google search” may not be enough. Moreover, the visit to the doctor can be both expensive and time consuming. 

<Look around when you walk or drive in the city, when you work, shop or have a leisure time. Note issues or any need or opportunity for improvement you see. Think of a solution through use of information systems. It well may be your lifetime invention, but it does not have to be an original idea. Feel free to search for information (recent article, report, case study, etc.) on a real working information system (or ideas for one) that solve the same problem somewhere else.>

<Any statement, number, estimation must be backed up by factual source. You need to insert references to any source referred to in the document. An example might be articles or Web sites that you consulted during the literature search. This should be done by adding footnotes at the exact points of reference in the main text. This should not be just a list of used materials.>
3.	Business Requirements
New system will provide the users with website/mobile application. First potential patients will have to go through registration process to input their personal information (passport, previous medical records). Then users will be asked to take the test where they will input all the symptoms that they have at the moment. Based on the answers application will prosses the results and choose the right doctor that patient should visit. The system will request the current location of the user to suggest the nearest clinic/hospital for consultation. After the place is chosen, the user can choose the available specialist where they can contact doctor. 

<Business requirements outline the capabilities the system will provide the organization. These requirements need to be explained at a high level so that the approval committee and, ultimately, the project team understand what the business expects from the final product. Business requirements summarize the features the information system must include, such as the ability to collect customer orders online or the ability for suppliers to receive inventory status information as sales occur.>
4.	Business Value
Considering the intangible benefit, with this project patients will be able to learn their diagnosis faster. Talking about tangible ones peope will save time by not going to the dortor's appointment physically but rather by joining an online consultation.
<The benefits (both tangible and intangible) that the system will create for the organization>

5.	Special Issues or Constraints:
<Special issues that have impact on the approval committee’s decision>
